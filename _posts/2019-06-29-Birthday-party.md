# Birthday party for the old people

2019.6.29

I together with a few other volunteers went to the Li Xing community, which is in the northern part of our city. Different from normal communities, people live in this communities are all old people, the youngest among them are over 70 years old. We sung birthday songs with the old people and gave performances to them. I act a stand-up comedy to them. the old people are all very happy.
