# Aerial Club's work exhibition

2018.10.28

My Aerial Club held a work exhibition in a shopping mall. I talked about how I started to play model planes. A herd of passerby stopped and watched our exhibition. Some of them seem to be interested in model planes, especially some young children. They asked us a lot of questions about the models. I was excited to see so much people watching our exhibition, since I did not expect a lot of people to be interested in model planes.
